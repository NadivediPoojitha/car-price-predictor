# car-price-predictor
Objective: Predict car prices based on features such as make, model, year, mileage, etc.
Conclusion: Random Forest Model: The cross-validated results show that the Random Forest model performs significantly better than the Linear Regression model in terms of both RMSE and R-squared. This means that the Random Forest model provides more accurate and reliable predictions for the car data.

Linear Regression Model: Although it is simpler, the Linear Regression model shows much higher RMSE and lower R-squared values, indicating poorer performance compared to the Random Forest model
